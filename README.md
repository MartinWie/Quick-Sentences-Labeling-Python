A quick and dirty python script to label a list of given sentences.

## Usage

1) Feed in a list of text blocks into "sentence_list"
2) Adapt "switcher" with your labels
3) Adapt the scripts output
4) Run the script.
(You can also add multiple labels to one text block by simply typing multiple numbers. For example, "12" would result in "Happy", "Sad" for the given sentence)
